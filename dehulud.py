"""DeHulud - sandworm threat meter for Dune: Awakening on Linux.

Shows how close you are to the sandworm attack threshold, as a percent and a bar, in a tiny
always-on-top window (or one terminal line). It finds the running game (Proton) by itself.

  dehulud.py                    window (falls back to text without tkinter or a local X display)
  dehulud.py --text             one-line meter in the terminal
  dehulud.py --launch %command% Steam launch options: starts the game as a child of DeHulud, so a
                                ptrace_scope of 1 (descendants only) allows the read

Read-only: it reads /proc/<pid>/{cmdline,maps,status} of your own processes, the game's memory with
process_vm_readv, the ptrace setting, /etc/os-release and its own config file. It never writes to the
game, never attaches a debugger, never signals or injects anything, sends no input and opens no network
connection (the window only opens a local X display, through its Unix socket).
Python 3.9+, standard library only.
